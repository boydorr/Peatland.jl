# Peatland.jl

*Package for running simulations of peatland vegetation and environment.*

## Summary

This codebase provides example runs for the NERC Landscape Decisions Project: Simulating UK plant biodiversity under climate change to aid landscape decision making. This particular section of the project aims to provide a dynamic model of peatland plant biodiversity in Wales and Scotland.

The underlying simulation code for this project can be found at [Simulation.jl](https://github.com/boydorr/Simulation.jl).
